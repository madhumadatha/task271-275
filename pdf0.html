        <p class="A"> perspective using the SAP reference models and predefined processes. A
 main focus is the clear presentation of the interrelations between modelling,
 implementing, configuring and executing Enterprise Systems processes.
 Among others, the SAP implementation methodology, Accelerated SAP, and
 mySAP.com will be introduced.</p>
        <p class="A"> This subject has the following theoretical objectives:</p>
     <li><p class="A">Provide students with an awareness of the issues concerning the manage
           ment of business processes.</p></li>
        <li><p class="A">Develop in students the capability to identify, model, reorganize, intro
duce, and manage continuously processes in a business organization.</p></li>
        <li><p class="A">Describe the characteristics of Enterprise Systems.</p></li>
        <li><p class="A">Explain how the reference data and process models of Enterprise
 Systems are structured.</p></li>
        <li><p class="A">Explain the relationships between the modelling, the customization, the
 execution, and the redesign of Enterprise Systems-based business pro
cesses.</p></li>
        <li><p class="A">Develop in students the capability to understand and customize the
 processes of Enterprise Systems according to given requirements in a
 business organization.</p></li>
        <p class="A"> Students have to work on three assignments. In these assignments they
 explore the Enterprise System SAP R/3. Students don’t get step-by-step
 instructions on how to use the system, but only a general introduction into the
 system navigation. They have to explore the system on their own and follow
 predefined processes. In their assignments, they discuss how to model,
 execute and configure these processes. This learning style puts the students
 into an active role and helps to build general skills in understanding the system
 design. This approach is based on the selected learning model. It is of
 importance for any off-campus offering as it reduces the necessary conversa
tion between lecturer and students.</p>
        <p class="A">Every student gets the required software, the user interface, in order to
 access the SAP software from home.</p>
        <h1 style="font-size: 25px;" class="A B"> Coordinated On-Campus and Off-Campus Offer</h1>
        <p class="A">  Process Engineering is offered as a traditional on-campus unit as well
 as an off-campus unit. The content and the assignments of these two are nearly
 identical. The only difference is that off-campus students have a choice
 between a final exam and another assignment, whereas on-campus students
 must take the exam. This assignment usually applies the theoretical knowl
edge about process modelling and process improvement to a workplace.
 During semesters in which Process Engineering is offered on-campus and off</p>
        <p class="A"> campus, local off-campus students have the opportunity to select one form of
 delivery. Most of these students prefer, if possible, attending the lectures.</p>
        <p class="A">All slides of the lectures are password-protected, published on the
 courses’ website and available for download. They include further notes
 and audio data captured with the tool, RealPresenter (www.real.com).
 Further explanations and experiences regarding this software can be
 found at Lightfood (1999).</p>
        <p class="A">At the beginning of the off-campus offering of Process Engineering,
 students could interact with the lecturer in weekly Internet chats. These chats
 tried to simulate a classroom atmosphere. The slides for the week were the
 guideline for the chat session. Students could ask questions and the lecturer
 gave further information. Furthermore, he asked students questions so that
 they were actively integrated in the lecture. After this virtual lecture, the chat
 was saved, revised and uploaded to the homepage of the subject. Thus, it was
 available for all students.</p>   
        <p class="A">Table 2 shows an extract from such a chat session. In fact, this chat was
 made in a semester in which the lecturer was located in Germany and the
 students were located all over Australia and New Zealand. A local tutor (Chris
 Nagel) supported this lecture. Microsoft’s NetMeeting was used as a commu
nication tool. The tutor hosted the session and controlled the participation to
 this chat session.</p>
        <p class="A">It turned out, that the students enjoyed these chat sessions very much. In
 fact, they tried to participate in these lectures even on their business trips.
 Extreme examples were the cases in which students were in airport lounges
 or even on an overseas holiday (Bahamas, 3:00 a.m.). It took approximately
 two weeks before all participants felt comfortable with this form of distance
 education. Furthermore, it took time before a “classroom atmosphere” with
 a moderating lecturer and attentive students was developed. Trials with
 participating students from other universities and more than one lecturer
 failed because of inexperienced participants. On average, 60-80 % of all off
campus students participated in these online chats. Their participation had no
 influence on their marks.</p>
        <p class="A">Occasionally, external experts were involved in these chat forums. In one
 case, for example, the SAP implementation methodology Accelerated SAP
 (ASAP) was discussed in the lecture. After one hour, a SAP employee from
 the German SAP headquarters, who was involved in the product development
 joined this chat session and students had the opportunity to ask questions.
 Later, a SAP consultant who was using ASAP for the implementation of</p>

        <p class="A">Human Resource Management solutions in London, UK, participated in the
 chat. In that way, the students learned the concepts and could talk to the
 product developer and user.</p>
        <p class="A"> In following semesters, off-campus students also received weekly video
tapes of the lecture, which they very much appreciated. Since then, the interest
 in weekly chats via the Internet was significantly reduced.</p>
        <p class="A"> In the next semesters it is planned to use a more sophisticated environ
ment for distance education that also allows bidirectional many-many audio
 communication (Virtual Classroom).</p>
        <p class="A"> The comparable course content allowed an analysis of the differences in
 the performance of on-campus and off-campus students. In correspondence
 with similar studies (e.g., Dobrin, 1999; Smeaton & Keogh, 1999), it turned
 out that focusing just on the grades in the identical assignments, no significant
 differences could be observed. Table 3 shows the average results for the most
 recent semester (Second Semester, 2000).

        <p class="A"> The participants of the international survey regarding teaching SAP R/3
 (Gable & Rosemann, 1999) were also asked if they were collaborating with
 other universities in their SAP R/3 initiative. Interest in collaboration was also
 gauged. A surprising number—50% of all respondent institutes—stated that
 they are collaborating in various ways with other universities; 35 % of all
 collaborations are on an international basis. There are no obvious patterns of
 differences across countries. Only two universities indicated that they are not
 interested in collaboration. Table 4 shows the areas of interest in cross
university collaboration. Respondents often mentioned multiple areas.</p>

        <p class="A">Research is obviously the most popular reason for collaboration between
 universities (see also, Hazemi et al., 1998). It is expected that Enterprise
 Systems-related research will be the “second wave” of Enterprise Systems
related activities at universities once systems are established in curriculum.
 Sharing of teaching material like lecture notes and the general exchange of
 knowledge and experiences are further main reasons for collaboration. In
 many cases, universities that have just commenced their SAP initiative are
 interested in input from experienced universities.</p>
        <p class="A"> Collaborative academic education in Enterprise Systems adds interaction
 between different faculties or universities to the distance education mode. An
 example for collaboration within one university is the Virtual Enterprise Project
 at the University of Missouri (University of Missouri, 2001). Participants from
</p>
        <p class="A"> four campuses collaborate in this project in the design of a virtual enterprise. Each
 of the four participating institutes contributes knowledge from different areas
 such as logistics, accounting, human resource management, or data warehousing
 (see Figure 3). They all use the same SAP installation, which requires detailed
 coordination of activities.</p>
        <h7 class="A"><i> Figure 3: The virtual enterprise project</i></h7>

        <h8 style="font-size: 20px;" class="A B">  Collaborative Assignments</h8>
        <p class="A"> A simple starting point for collaboration between universities is the
 definition and use of the same assignment (content and specification, such as
 deadlines) for students at different universities.</p>
        <p class="A"> This approach conforms with the proposed learning model. Rather
 than following the objective model and, for example, providing lectures
 from one university to other institutes, students interact and learn from
 each other under the moderation of more than one instructor. This format
 is open-ended and places responsibility on the participant. Instead of
 passive consumption, the participants have an active role and face a
 continuous pressure to contribute.</p>
        <p class="A"> The following description of such an initiative in collaborative and
 distance Enterprise Systems education is based on a project between
 Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Brisbane, The University of
 Texas at Austin (UT), and the Louisiana State University (LSU) (Rosemann
 et al., 2000). This pilot was the first step towards a more comprehensive
 participation and understanding of global collaboration in the area of teaching
 SAP R/3. It took place in September and October 1999.
